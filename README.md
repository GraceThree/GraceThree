Hi, Iâ€™m Grace @GraceThree
I'm a math MS student in the process of switching over to physics, without a great background in either.
I'm making this to serve as a public place to host TeX files of textbook problem sets, so that way I can create some evidence that I understand things.
It'll also probably be useful as a place to put code when I do it, but that's not very often.
